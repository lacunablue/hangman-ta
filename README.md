# hangman-ta
My variation of MIT60001 OCW's Problem Set 2: Hangman.

Instructions for vanilla version:
- This is a console/terminal only program created using Spyder
1. Make sure all files are saved to the same directory/folder
2. Open hangman-ta.py in an IDE console or terminal
3. Run file ("F5" in Spyder, "Shift" + "F10" in PyCharm)
4. Read through console prompts and enter single-letter guesses
5. You have 6 total guesses

TO DO
- [ ] Add testing file / test cases
- [X] Add reminder if user doesn't enter single letters
- [X] Add input filter for letters only
- [X] Add strikes if user inputs same letter more than once
- [ ] Add incremented hanged man image for incorrect guesses
- [X] Add score
- [ ] Reformat via peer review/PEP8
