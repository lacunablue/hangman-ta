# hangman-ta
My variation of MIT60001 OCW's Problem Set 2: Hangman. 
-This is not yet complete as Problem Set 2 requires warnings, heftier penalty for mis-guessed vowels, and score.

Instructions for vanilla version:
- This is a console only program currently, created using Spyder.
1. Open in an IDE or web editor like Repl.it or trinket.io/python
2. Run file ("F5" in Spyder).  Read through console prompts and enter single letter guesses
3. You have 6 total guesses

TO DO
- [ ] Add warnings if user doesn't enter single letters
- [ ] Add input filter for letters only
- [ ] Add hints
- [ ] Add reply if user inputs same letter more than once
- [ ] Add incremented hanged man image for incorrect guesses
- [ ] Add score
- [ ] Add heftier penalty for wrong vowel guess
